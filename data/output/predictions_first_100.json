        "[1] the following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations under property and casualty contracts : reserves for property & casualty unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported ( ibnr ) .",
        "while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company , the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate , subject to significant uncertainty .",
        "the actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant .",
        "final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates , particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future .",
        "in estimating the timing of future payments by year , the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue .",
        "however , the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to , among other things , changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements .",
        "in particular , there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims .",
        "also , estimated payments in 2005 do not include payments that will be made on claims incurred in 2005 on policies that were in force as of december 31 , 2004 .",
        "in addition , the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that will be used , in part , to fund loss payments .",
        "under generally accepted accounting principles , the company is only permitted to discount reserves for claim and claim adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and reliably determinable on an individual claim basis .",
        "for the company , these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants and certain structured settlement contracts that fund loss runoffs for unrelated parties .",
        "as of december 31 , 2004 , the total property and casualty reserves in the above table of $ 21885 are gross of the reserve discount of $ 556 .",

        "life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs .",
        "in contrast to this table , the majority of life 2019s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account value , as described in critical accounting estimates , and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth , interest crediting , or future deposits .",
        "therefore , the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses , other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities .",
        "due to the significance of the assumptions used , the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results .",
        "as separate account obligations are legally insulated from general account obligations , the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from separate account assets .",
